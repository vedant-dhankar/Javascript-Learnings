var myName = "vedant chaudhary";//naming variable
var myAge = 18;
console.log(myName);//for outpup
console.log(myAge)

// 1st characher must be a letter or an underscore(_) or dollar($)
// you cannot use a number as 1st characher
// eg myAge is good but 1age not good

// u cannot use var as var or let as let
// cannot use specail carachers
